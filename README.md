# New Example Rust File System 
Basic filesystem example project
This is a simple filesystem example project that can be compiled to the wasm32-wasip1 target and run in dfx.
It demonstrates how to initialize the ic_wasi_polyfill and then use the standard std::fs module to read and write files and directories.
